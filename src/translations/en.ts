          "According to the data from Inclient.ru portal, in 2022, Telegram was most frequently downloaded in India (70.48 million), Russia (24.15 million), the USA (20.03 million), Indonesia (19.61 million), and Brazil (18.04 million). The messenger is popular among users in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and the USA. Moreover, by the end of 2022, the Telegram audience increased from 25.5 million to 48.8 million users.",
          '"Nowadays, Telegram is second only to WhatsApp, and the gap narrows every year. It\'s no wonder our competitors are worried," said Durov.',
          "The launch of the first official advertising turned Telegram into one of the most promising platforms for marketing in the near future. Let's figure out how it works.",
          "Telegram Ads is an advertising account for setting up targeted advertising in public channels of the messenger. Advertising is shown in all open channels with an audience of more than 1,000 subscribers. To launch advertising, you need to write an ad text, set a bid, and choose a target audience.",
          "The ad must consist of a title, text, and button:",
          "Title - the name of the channel with an active link to it.",
          "The text can be up to 160 characters long.",
          "The button can lead to the channel, bot, or message in the channel.",
          "You can't attach images, gifs, or videos, but you can use emojis in ads.",
          "How advertising works",
          "Telegram Ads offers a unique advertising payment model - CPM (cost per 1000 impressions). You need to specify your bid, i.e., the price you are willing to pay for 1000 impressions. The minimum bid is only 2 euros.",
          "An automatic first-price auction is used to determine impressions, meaning you compete for impressions of your ads. The higher your bid, the more likely your ad will be shown.",
          "You are provided with the opportunity to choose the placement of ads - automatically or manually. You can also set targeting to subscribers of your own channel or based on user interests. You can also specify exceptions - topics or channels where you do not want to show ads.",
          "With automatic setup, you choose a theme, such as travel, technology, or marketing, and the platform selects channels to place your ad. You cannot view the list of channels on the platform itself.",
          "With manual setup, you can select specific channels where you want to place the ad by specifying links to them. You can specify up to 100 channels for one ad with exceptions taken into account.",
          "When using targeting based on user interests, you can specify a country, region, or city, as well as specify interests themselves. The platform determines user interests based on their subscriptions.",
          "What you can't advertise",

          "1. Separate field for URLs: There is now a separate field for URLs to launch ads directly to the site. In addition, you can add UTM tags and ERid for more accurate ad labeling.",
          "2. Additional field for title: If you advertise an external site, you will see an additional field for entering a title. This gives you an additional 40 characters of text to make your ad more noticeable.",
          "3. Link flexibility: Now you can insert a link into the button or leave it in the ad text. If the link remains in the text, you can shorten it in size. Note that links in the text and button must match.",
          "4. New data in the advertising account: With the Telegram Ads update, you can see additional information about your advertising campaign. The number of clicks, CPC, and CTR - all this is in your account.",

          "One of the most creative ideas in gambling is influencing traffic, which perfectly fits into gambling: a quick opportunity to earn money on luck and calculations. At the same time, the “algorithms” have been shooting in Russia and the CIS for years, but they took a long time to reach the foreign markets. However, in the last couple of years, on any gambling affiliate network, you can find several offers for geo predominantly from tier-2 and tier-3, which such traffic will be accepted on.",
          "How We Came to Greece",
          "We already had some experience working with some CIS geos, but they were squeezed dry by years of mass flooding, as only the lazy did not make TG channels for these geos.",
          "What was the specificity of working with Greece, and what is it now? This is a geo where there is no clear market for direct advertising, which means it will be difficult to buy from publics and directly. In the embryonic stage, there is a market and even, perhaps, more lively than many countries, but it is far from what we have in Russia or Ukraine. Everything came to an obvious solution: we need to pour from FB, because this is the only thing that will give volume and quality.",
          "How We Worked",
          "After a few days of testing, everyone came to simple ideas: direct posts with advertising of earnings and successful images on the background. Here are examples of good creatives that still convert:",
          "With a payout of around $105 and ROI consistently at the threshold of 250% and higher, it was a great boost that we worked on for a long time, for a year, if not more.",
          "We stopped only at the moment of the FB storm and took a small break. We are still pouring, the ROI is now lower and the ads are moderated worse, but plus we have stability.",
          "Landing Page",
          "Instagram is a fast and continuous process, the player does not get lost when switching to another messenger and makes a deposit immediately. But working with reruns is more difficult. At a distance, this often does not pay off, and there may be questions about the quality of traffic. As for Greece, processing was only on Insta because few people use Telegram.",
          "We launched through Instagram with the goal of “engagement” and poured with payment for messages and translation to the casino.",
          "Telegram is a more expensive subscription and lead, but it is more convenient to work with and shows good results in the long run. Especially convenient if you transfer the audience to another offer: you can immediately pour one notification with a new link to all subscribers.",
          "On Telegram, we launch traffic for conversions, set up the pixel for tracking, and select the “Leads” goal. Thus, there was no need to spend time on primary processing in Insta, the person immediately got into Telegram.",
          "In Conclusion",
          "Influence and Greece are the perfect combination. Hundreds of thousands of users who dream of not working and getting rich faster, and then the “ideal” way how they can do it. Try pouring on this geo and you will be happy!",
